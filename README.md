Test Application for Managing a Home Budget

Hopefully we'll learn a decent amount of Ruby on Rails along the way.

The goal is to make a simple website to handle a typical household budget.

The site will feature:
* No Login's Required.
* Retrieval of account details by session ID OR a made up Phrase.
* User Account can be created to lock down the account details.
* Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly spending habits.
* Auto, Mortgage, or Loan pay off calculations.
